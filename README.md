# customer-segmentation
Introduction
RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as

how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
how often they purchase (frequency)
how much the customer spends (monetary)
It is based on the marketing axiom that 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers. RFM helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.

Data
To calculate the RFM score for each customer we need transaction data which should include the following:

a unique customer id
last date of transaction/order
transaction/order amount
